            Hey there! If you're on this site, chances are you already know me and this site.
            If not: I'm a Software Engineering student, and this is my personal semi-private site.
            I currently do not intend to link to this on my public profiles or anything like that,
            and I'd appreciate if you would keep it "secret." Beware that most of this site is
            always under development; parts of it could change, the url/domain could change, the
            entire site could disappear, etc.
